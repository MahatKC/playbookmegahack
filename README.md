Unity was used to develop the **Play Book** ***"O Peixinho Perdeu O Inho"***. It used C# code for most of it and some block programming for the animations.

The Play Book idea was created to bridge the gap between books and games, making kids more interested in reading by bringing interaction elements found in games to written stories.
